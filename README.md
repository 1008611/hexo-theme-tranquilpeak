## Showcase ##

I would like to create a showcase with all blogs having a customized version of tranquilpeak theme. 
If you have customized the original version, please, add yours by creating an [issue](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/tranquilpeak-hexo-theme/issues/new?title=Add%20my%20blog%20into%20showcase&body=Hey,%20the%20URL%20of%20my%20blog%20is:%20)  
or by following these steps :  
1. Fork the project  
2. On the dev branch, add your blog URL, a short description of your changes and your github name into `SHOWCASE.md` file
3. Respect the format : `[blog_name](url_of_your_blog) - short_description_of_your_changes - [github_name](url_of_your_github_page)`
3. Create a pull request on the dev branch   

I will judge if the theme is enough customized to be added into showcase.
